ok here is what i have done so far
> ran both ui and api with out docker

 - app/ui : sveltekit app is working fine, using adoptor-node runs on port:3000 and output is in build not in other folder. i have build it , preview it.

 - app/api also works fine and access on port:5000 but obviously not connected to database since not using docker-compose so far
